# Tic-Tac-Toe
---

Tic Tac Toe was a side project based on what I learned in CPSC 231 (Introduction to Computer Science). I hope this gives future student some confidence and insight on making their own projects.

Also check out the group project we had to make: [Apocalypse](https://github.com/Step7750/Apocalypse)
